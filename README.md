Developed a multi-component React application using Redux for state
management. The application consists of four main components: Main,
Post, Search, and Quizzie. The application utilizes Redux for state
management and React Router for navigation. This project demonstrates
my ability to integrate Redux with React for efficient state management
and navigation handling in a real-world application.
